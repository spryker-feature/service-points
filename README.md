# Spryker Feature: Service Points

Service Points represent physical locations that aggregate multiple services. These locations enable the combination of different services to establish a variety of service points, such as warehouses or physical stores, providing developers with a flexible and modular approach to designing solutions. For example, In-Store Pickup can be incorporated as one of the available services.
